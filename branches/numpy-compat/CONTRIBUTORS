PPGPLOT CONTRIBUTORS:

Many thanks to M.A. Breddels (http://www.astro.rug.nl/~breddels/).
If it wasn't for him, ppgplot would have been lost long ago! 
Appart from this, he is also responsible for:

    - The original version of the "setup.py" script

    - Adding support for the pgplot functions: pginf, pgpoly, pgvp, 
      pgqvsz, pgsclp, pgqclp, pgqtxt, pgconf.
