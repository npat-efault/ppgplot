If you have the "numpy", "numarray" or "Numeric" python packages, and
PGPLOT installed, and the PGPLOT_DIR environmental variable is
pointing to the directory where PGPLOT is installed, it should be
possible to install ppgplot with one command (issued as user "root"):

 # python setup.py install

If the pgplot libraries are in some other directory, or you don't feel
like setting the PGPLOT_DIR, try this (again as user "root"):

 # python setup.py build_ext -L/usr/local/pgplot
 # python setup.py install

Assuming "/usr/local/pgplot" is the directory where PGPLOT is
installed.

Depending on how you compiled PGPLOT, you may need to link ppgplot
with additional runtime libraries. If compilation (linking) of the
extension fails due to unresolved symbols, then this is probably the
case. A common culprit for this is the PNG library, which is needed if
you compiled PGPLOT with PNG driver support. It this case comment-in
the line:
#    libraries.append("png")

in "setup.py", and try again.

If you are compiling with an older fortran compiler (e.g. not gfortran),
then you may need to comment-in the following line in setup.py:
#    libraries.append("g2c")

Since 1.4 ppgplot is configured to prefer "numpy" over "numarray" over
"Numeric".  If for some reason you want to use "numarray" or
"Numeric", then uncomment the appropriate "raise ImportError" lines in
setup.py

Have fun ! :)
