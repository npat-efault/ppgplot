If you have the "Numeric" or "numarray" python packages, and PGPLOT
installed, and the PGPLOT_DIR environmental variable is pointing to
the directory where PGPLOT is installed, it should be possible to
install ppgplot with one command (issued as user "root"):

 # python setup.py install

If the pgplot libraries are in some other directory, or you don't feel
like setting the PGPLOT_DIR, try this (again as user "root"):

 # python setup.py build_ext -L/usr/local/pgplot
 # python setup.py install

Assuming "/usr/local/pgplot" is the directory where PGPLOT is
installed.

Depending on how you compiled PGPLOT, you may need to link ppgplot
with additional runtime libraries. If compilation (linking) of the
extension fails due to unresolved symbols, then this is probably the
case. A common culprit for this is the PNG library, which is needed if
you compiled PGPLOT with PNG driver support. It this case comment-in
the line:

#    libraries.append("png")

in "setup.py", and try again.

Since 1.3 ppgplot is configured to use "numarray", instead of
"Numeric" if the former is found. If you have both "Numeric" and
"numarray" istalled, and for some reason you want to use "Numeric",
then in "setup.py" replace the line:

    from numarray.numarrayext import NumarrayExtension

with:
  
    raise ImportError

This should make the script believe that you don't have "numarray" and
use "Numeric" instead.

Have fun ! :)
