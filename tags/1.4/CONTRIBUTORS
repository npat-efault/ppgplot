PPGPLOT CONTRIBUTORS:

Steven Bamford adapted ppgplot in 2007 to use numpy, in favour of the
depreciated numarray and Numeric modules, and included these minor
changes (mostly to setup.py) in the Google Code version (1.4) in April
2011.

Nick Patavalis originally wrote ppgplot back in 1998, and after
"rediscovering" it in 2003, thanks to M.A. Breddels, gave it an update
(to 1.3) and hosted the most recent version.  The source was
eventually put on Google Code, in February 2011, to ensure long-term
availability.

Many thanks to M.A. Breddels (http://www.astro.rug.nl/~breddels/),
who hosted and developed the ppgplot source code in the early 2000s.
If it wasn't for him, ppgplot would have been lost long ago! 
Apart from this, he is also responsible for:

    - The original version of the "setup.py" script

    - Adding support for the pgplot functions: pginf, pgpoly, pgvp, 
      pgqvsz, pgsclp, pgqclp, pgqtxt, pgconf.
