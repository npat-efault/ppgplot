version 1.4
  - Now ppgplot uses the "numpy" module by default, reverting to "numarray"
    and then "Numeric", respectively, if the preferred module is not found.
    See INSTALL for instructions on how to disable this.

version 1.3
  - Now ppgplot can also use the "numarray" package, taking advantage of 
    the legacy (compatibility) C-API. The setup script will use 
    "numarray" by default, if it is found, otherwise it will revert 
    to using "Numeric". See INSTALL for instructions on how to disable 
    this.
  - A new set of example files were created, that import "numarray" 
    instead of "Numeric". The new files are named "na_ex_*.py"

version 1.2
  - Cleaned-up and spiced-up "setup.py", a bit. Now ppgplot installs 
    as a package.
  - Silenced some spurious warning triggered by modern GCCs, and modern 
    Pythons.
  - Restructured the source distribution.
  - Added more examples.
